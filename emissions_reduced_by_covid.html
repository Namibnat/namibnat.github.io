    <h1>Paper Review: Fossil CO2 emissions in the post-COVID-19 era</h1>

    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
    Having worked as a guide, guide trainer and similar roles for decades, I have an interest in nature.
    Having recently moved to the UK, I want to continue my education in the natural world.  One way for me to do this is to read papers that interest me.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    These pages are my thoughts about what I'm reading.
    Although I'm reading scientific papers and chatting about them here, this isn't science.  Think of these as my notes, for me.
    But you're welcome to read them and let me know what you think.

    Today I read a paper called "Fossil CO2 emissions in the post-COVID-19 era".  See the citation below.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I'm writing this in the early months of 2021, and Covid-19 has been a major factor influencing the world today.
    As a concerned nature enthusiast, the influence that the 'Covid' erra has left us with is of great interest.  So, this paper is interesting to me.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The lockdowns around the world have given us an experiment in climate mitigation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The paper starts out with an interesting statement.  It states "Global fossil CO2 emissions have decreased by around 2.6 GtCO2 in 2020".
    That is 2.6 Gigatons less CO2.  The paper claims that this brings CO2 emissions to 7% less than 2019.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We have never had a drop in emissions of this scale.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement">The Paris Agreement</a>
    requires a reduction in emissions between one and two gigatons a year globally.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This raises in interesting idea to ponder.  Global reductions in emissions have rarely been more than about 0.1 Gigatons.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Covid was so incredibly disruptive to activities around the world.  I used to work in tourism.  Globally, tourism has come to a standstill due to Covid.
    This means flights, busses, trains and planes were all reduced on a massive scale.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Another area  which caused a reduction in emissions was work.  The scale of the reduction in travel to and from work was massive.  <em>Massive</em>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    And we can go on to consider many similar reductions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Taken together it would be impossible to reproduce the effect.
    But, this is the kind of scale we need to bring global emissions of CO2 in line with the Paris agreement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    There are many lessons learned that might be of some help going forward.  One things that is very likely is that many more people will work from home.
    Global travel is also likely to take years to be back to pre-covid levels.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Despite these glimmers of hope, the scale of  slowdown caused by covid is to going to be hard to replicate.
    Simply asking people to ride bicycles or buy electric cars is nowhere near the change we need to see.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I thought it was interesting to read for the simple thought of what we need to do going forward.  <em>The task at hand is massive</em>!
